Ash is captured by Team Rocket. He is hidden somewhere in the map and Pikachu has to rescue him. However, there are other rival pokemons hidden in the map as as well. The purpose of the game is to find Ash before Pikachu's health reaches zero.

Game play:

1) If Pikachu meets another rival pokemon, he needs to battle using the dice provided on the screen.
2) If Pikachu picks up a potion, its health will increase by 10%
3) If Pikachu finds Ash, the game will end.


How the dices works:

Everytime the dices are rolled, the higher of the two will win and health will be deducted from the other party. The battle ends once the health of either parties reaches zero.

Scenario 1:

If Pikachu's health reaches zero, the game will end. Click "Start Game" to start a new game.


Scenario 2:

If Pikachu wins, Pikachu will gain experience points. Once the experience points reach full bar, Pikachu can evolved into Raichu. Pick another box to continue the game till you find Ash.
